    "# Coursera Capstone Project - Car accident severity\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the capstone project from the IBM Data Science Profesional Certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Car Accidents are a leading cause of serius injury and death in the world. There is the common opinion that gathering statistics, facts and information about these accidents could help to understand what are the most important factors that lead to a traffic crash. Knowing this, Goverments may create a policy to reduce accidents, as well as severity.\n",

A [document](https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Metadata.pdf) explained the metada is also attached. \n",
